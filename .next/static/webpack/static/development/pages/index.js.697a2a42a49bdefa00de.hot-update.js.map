Oasis Discovery is designed to keep up with today’s hybrid IT, regardless of the location of the assets and in spite of increasing rates in change volume and change types. Auto-discovery is crucial to your business because it is impossible to stay up to date with this tremendous volume of devices, applications and cloud resources without the help of a powerful tool.<br/><br/>Two of the most important components of an IT Operations Management Platform are discovering all of your logical, physical and virtual assets and automatically maintaining an accurate CMDB. Additionally, the CMDB demands knowing how each element is related to the business; there must always be context and no element or Configuration Item (CI) can be an island unto itself.\n    <br/><br/>The Oasis discovery engine is completely agentless, lightning fast, lightweight, and requires minimal credentials and IP addresses to do its work. The output of the Oasis Discovery engine drives the Oasis Analytics, Reporting and Automation Components. All assets and any changes are updated in near real-time.\n    <br/><br/>Discovery methods that are leveraged in Oasis include: ICMP, Netbios, SMB, SNMP, JMX, WinRM, SSH and credentials to inspect virtual environments, cloud-based resources in Azure, AWS, Google and containers with management layers such as Kubernetes. Application relationships can be discovered passively through a combination of SNMP, SSH, WinRM and Netflow: depending on your own policies for polling.</p>\n  },\n  {\n    id: 3,\n    altText: 'Application and Infrastructure Monitoring',\n\n    img: '/static/images/appmonitoringmodal.jpg',\n    subtitle: <div className=\"ptype\">Oasis, based on how it is configured, can monitor virtually anything and everything.

It is important to note, however, that there are numerous products that work well in tandem with Oasis; that flexibility allows us to integrate with your existing ITOM tools, home grown monitoring, element managers and performance management solutions.<br/><br/>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Measure end-user-experience and application performance via synthetic checks</li>\n      <li>Network analysis of traffic to monitor production traffic</li>\n      <li>Application Performance Monitoring</li>\n      <li>Core Monitoring (Availability, SLA, Event, Asset, Incident, Service Management, and more)</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n  },\n  {\n    id: 4,\n    altText: 'Oasis Advanced Analytics',\n\n    img: '/static/images/analyticsmodal.jpg',\n    subtitle: <h4>Oasis delivers business impacting information straight out of your raw data.</h4>,\n    caption: <div className=\"ptype\">Countless feeds from your devices, applications, logs and events are consumed by the Oasis ingestion engine, then normalized to generate context.

Go from thousands of daily events down to a manageable volume for your\n              NOC staff - a sure way to increase productivity. With OEM, they're able to pinpoint the root cause of business\n              impacting events such as outages and performance degradations, quicker. <br/><br/>\n\n              Events are automatically correlated to the services they impact so your operations team can prioritize\n              troubleshooting. Additionally, Oasis Analytics proactively finds at-risk applications and devices, then alerts to\n              their deterioration and heightened risk to the business. The synthetic Application Assurance tool constantly\n              checks real world transactions for response time and availability. Systems are confirmed for both availability\n              and reachability. For example, Oasis knows that a service may be unavailable because the NAS is unreachable\n              due to a faulty switch. But the NAS is working properly and the appropriate team is dispatched to repair the\n              switch. <br/><br/>\n              The Oasis Event Manager is viewed through a single dashboard view and organized in a built-in view or by\n              readily customizable templates. This flexibility matches the way your personnel work today so productivity is\n              immediate and resolution times are reduced. The Oasis Dashboards are all convertible to Reports which can be\n              scheduled, mailed or published to any portal. Key information is generated out-of-the-box, such as the Top\n              Devices with Events and the Top Events generated. When maintenance windows are implemented, Oasis knows\n              how to calibrate for Availability and Performance metrics and keeps alerts from being generated to the\n              Helpdesk. Save your staff time and headaches.</p>\n  },\n  {\n    id: 6,\n    altText: 'Trap Adapter SNMP',\n\n    img: '/static/images/trapadaptormodal.jpg',\n    subtitle: <h4>The Oasis Trap Adapter SNMP</h4>,\n    caption: <div className=\"ptype\">The Oasis Trap Adapter is a fully configurable Trap Listener and Forwarder with native integration to the Oasis Platform.
